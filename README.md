## Conclusion

In this project, we have presented a novel framework for fashion recommendation that is driven by data, 
visually related and simple effective recommendation systems for generating fashion product images. 
The proposed approach uses a two-stage phase. Initially, our proposed approach extracts the features 
of the image using CNN classifier ie., for instance allowing the customers to upload any random 
fashion image from any E-commerce website and later generating similar images to the uploaded image 
based on the features and texture of the input image. It is imperative that such research goes forward 
to facilitate greater recommendation accuracy and improve the overall experience of fashion 
exploration for direct and indirect consumers alike.
